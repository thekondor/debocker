* Things to do (ordered by priority)
** add --debug to build the package with all debugging information
** add more tests
** replace --from with "docker rmi --no-prune=true"
** it's not clear if running the build process as root is safe; switch to a normal user maybe?
* Things to consider
** consider using docker API (python-docker)
* Done
** skip .git directory from sources; actually, probably just store orig tarball
** let pass build flags to dpkg-buildpackage
** the bundles are not reproducible => make them so
** add support for other dists (stable, experimental, etc.)
